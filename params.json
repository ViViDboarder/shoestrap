{"name":"Shoestrap","body":"## What is Shoestrap?\r\n\r\nShoestrap is a simple Bash-based alternative to Chef and Puppet. It speaks Bash so there's virtually no learning curve. More importantly, you won't have to learn yet another DSL. Shoestrap aims to get out of your way.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to get up and running in minutes, not hours.\r\n\r\n## What's wrong with Chef, Puppet and co.?\r\n\r\nChef and Puppet are great tools, but they are too complex for most use cases.\r\nThe learning curve for these tools is quite steep as they each have their own\r\nDSL. On the other end, Shoestrap is just Bash. It does not require any\r\n'Bash to config files' translation.\r\n\r\nI believe Shoestrap is a great simple alternative to Chef or Puppet that will\r\nfulfill the needs of most people.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nYou can see a sample cookbook at [http://github.com/cmer/shoestrap-example](http://github.com/cmer/shoestrap-example).\r\n","tagline":"A simple alternative to Chef and Puppet","google":"UA-87295-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
